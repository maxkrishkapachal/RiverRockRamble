- Cardamon...? That can't be it... 
- Turmeric? No, no, no, no.
- None of these are right...
- Roxie, what spice am I missing?
- Oh, you wouldn't know... You don't even know what I'm making.
- It's soup! Good for the heart, the soul, the mind, and perfect to share with friends.
- I'd love to share some soup with you too, but I can't remember the last spice I'm missing.
- If only I didn't lend my recipe book to...
- ...someone...?
- Ah, I'm so forgetful!

- If you come across my recipe book, do return it, won't you?
- Then we can all have soup!
- Or if you have any good soup spice suggestions,
- I'm desperate enough to be taking those at this time as well.

- I hope you're not looking for more soup, Roxie,
- because it is no more.
- I couldn't get enough of the stuff!
- Once I started, I couldn't stop!
- I'll make more later though, come by again soon.
