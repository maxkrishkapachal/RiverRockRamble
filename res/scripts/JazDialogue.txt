- Hello, Roxie.
- How are you today?
- ...
- That's wonderful.
- Me? Oh, I'm... fine...
- I'm trying to learn my new dance, here -
- see, I'm planning it out here in the ground -
- but my dancing gloves are so worn out that they practically fell apart while I was dancing!
- I can't dance without them because the wheat is too hard on my palms.
- So instead, I'm just planning some more, but I wish I could continue dancing...

- What's that?
- ...
- You want this stick?
- Well, I could give it to you... but then what would I do?
- Can't dance without gloves and can't plan without a stick.
- Sorry, Roxie.

- That's a pretty cool thing you got there,
- but it won't get you this stick.
- Sorry, Roxie.

- Whoa! No way!
- You really found more gloves?? How did you do that?
- We're in prehistoric times, gloves haven't even been invented yet!
- Thank you so much, Roxie!
- This stick is all yours!
