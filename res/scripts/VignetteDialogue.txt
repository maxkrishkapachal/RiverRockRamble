- That angle is ugly. So is that one. Ugly. Ugly.
- This is so terrible! There's no way I can make these rocks look nice!
- I need something else... I can't work with these conditions.

- FLOWERS! Why didn't I think of that!
- You are so so so smart, Roxie!
- Flowers are perfect! This is so much better than my rock idea.
- I won't be needing these rocks anymore, that's for sure!
- I'm so excited to make these photos pop!
