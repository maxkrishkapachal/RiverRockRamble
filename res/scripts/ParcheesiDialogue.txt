- Roxie, do you wanna play a game with me?
- Well, I guess you can't. I don't have any dice!
- I accidentally dropped them and I don't know where they went!
- And I was all ready to play, too.
- I have my board, my game gloves, my deck of cards, all the setup, it's all perfect!
- This is so frustrating! I don't have any other dice on me.
- :(

- I could... make dice?

- I don't think I can fashion dice out of that.
- But thanks for trying, Roxie.
- You're a good friend.

- My dice!! You found them! And they're all cleaned??
- Who cleaned my dice? They're so soft!
- Was it you? You're so kind!
- I don't even need these gloves anymore!
- Thank you, Roxie!
- You should come play a game with me if you ever have time.
