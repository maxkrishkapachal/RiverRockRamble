- Ah, good afternoon, Roxie.
- Come to enjoy some flowers?
- You're in the right place!
- I've been tending to these lovely little bulbs for so long,
- and they've finally blossomed. I'm so happy!
- Stay as long as you like, Roxie.

- Hello again, Roxie. Did you need something?
- ...
- Some flowers? Of course, I could spare a couple.
- Only if you bring me something to eat though, I'm starving.
- Caring for these gentle little creatures is hard work.
- Do that and the flowers are yours!

- Oh, that's sure nice, Roxie, but I can't eat it.
- I don't think you should either.
- Really, I hope you know that that isn't edible.

- Soup!
- Oh, Roxie, soup! Thank you!
- I can't tell you how much I love soup.
- How'd you know? Well, everyone loves soup I suppose.
- Anyway, here are your flowers. I collected them while you were gone.
- Enjoy them, Roxie!

- Good afternoon, Roxie.
- I hope those flowers are treating you well and vice versa.
- Feel free to enjoy my other flowers as well!
